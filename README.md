# DESCRIPTION
In this task, we developed a Java application that consumes a public REST API to fetch real-time data (such as weather information). The program sends an HTTP request to the API server, receives the response in JSON format, and parses the JSON data to extract relevant information. The fetched data is then displayed in a structured and readable format on the console. This task demonstrates how Java handles HTTP connections and processes JSON responses from external web services.
